Know Issues :
  * Multiple connections: updating a service (e.g. MqttDataTransport) of a connection
    has the effect to cause the unwanted reactivation of the next higher layer service (i.e. DataService)
    of the other connection(s). This in turn will cause the reactivation of all dependent components.
    This is not desired and not yet understood (Equinox bug?). See also Github issue #311.
  * Modem: Ublox Lisa U201 may not be able to establish PPP connection when CHAP/PAP authentication is required.
  * BLE only tested on the Raspberry Pi B with a Broadcom BCM20702 USB dongle and the TI SensorTag. The kernel version was "Linux raspberrypi 3.18.11-v7+ #781 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 21 18:07:59 BST 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux".

    The only working version of BlueZ is 4.101. The deb package is not available from Raspbian so it
    must be compiled from sources.
  * WiFi on Raspberry Pi only tested with WiPi WiFi Dongle (Realink RT5370 chipset) and official Pi USB WiFi Dongle (Broadcom BCM43143 chipset).
    AccessPoint WiFi mode not working for Broadcom chipset.
  * The reference JVMs are Oracle Java SE Embedded version 7 Update 40 and Java SE Embedded version 8 Update 65.
  * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
  * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
    in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
  * When first modem configuration is submitted, unconfigured cellular interface for serial modem (e.g. HE910) is not being replaced by
    ppp0 interface. Both ppp0 and HE910 interfaces are shown in the Web Admin.
  * Web UI may hang when configuration snapshot is uploaded. This happens because HTTP connection is lost due to toggling of the network interface which happened even if network configuration hasn't been modified.
